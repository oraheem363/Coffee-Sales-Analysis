# Project Insights:
Analysis of total revenue across coffee types reveals that sales are concentrated around a few high-performing beverages, reflecting strong customer preferences and consistent purchasing patterns.
Latte ($26,875.30) recorded the highest total revenue, confirming it as the café’s most profitable and premium beverage. Its popularity may be linked to its creamy texture and versatility in customizations.
Americano with Milk ($24,751.12) ranked second, showing strong volume-driven revenue. Its balance between affordability and taste appeals to regular customers seeking a lighter option than a full latte.
Cappuccino ($17,439.14) held third place, maintaining steady performance among customers who prefer a rich, foamy texture.
Americano ($14,650.26) contributed significantly, highlighting continued demand for classic, strong coffee options.
Hot Chocolate ($9,933.46) and Cocoa ($8,521.16) performed moderately well, showing that non-coffee beverages remain an important revenue source for diversification.
Cortado ($7,384.86) and Espresso ($2,690.28) produced the lowest revenues, reflecting their niche customer base and smaller serving sizes.
